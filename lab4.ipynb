    "## Introduction <a name=\"in\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far in 571 and 573 together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. Since this mini-project is open-ended there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you instead do a bunch of sane things and you have clearly motivated your choices, but still get lower model performance than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, the style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"several hours\" but not \"many hours\" is a good guideline for a high quality submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and we hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "1. A classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. A regression problem of predicting `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing with [New York City Airbnb listings from 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means. Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",

    "Looking into the data set there are many features initially proposed of which many are relevant to the machine-learning model building process. Features like `ID` and `SEX` as the former contains all unique identifiers for each observation while the latter will introduce an ethical bias into the experiement. The observations that relate to `others` and `unknown` under the `EDUCATION` column will be dropped to only keep `graduate school`, `university`, and `high school` as they have an inherent order. The columns names for the `PAY`, `BILL_AMT`, and `PAY_AMT` features are hard to interpret so they will be renamed to include their respective months. The `default.payment.next.month` column will also be renamed to `TARGET` to keep it short. Under the `MARRIED` column, any values pertaining to `single` or `other` will be converted to `not-married` for simplicity as it is not clear what `other` means, this also helps to create a binary feature. The features that are categorical already have some form of encoding which helps the transformation process down the line for interpretability."
